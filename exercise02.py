Question 2
Given the following dictionaries:

d1 = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30}
d2 = {'d': 100, 'e': 200, 'f': 300}
d3 = {'f': 30, 'g': 40}
Construct two lists, one containing all the keys of both dictionaries, and one
containing all the values of each dictionary. (It is OK for values or keys to
be repeated in the lists).

In the example above you should end up with two lists containing the elements:

'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'f', 'g'
and

10, 20, 30, 100, 200, 300, 30, 40
Note that the order in which the elements appear in each list is not important.
